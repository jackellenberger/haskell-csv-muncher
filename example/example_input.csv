Project;Description;,Emojme,"An improvement on my work on emojipacks, with a complete rewrite adding bulk emoji download, upload, syncing, and statistics through a reverse engineered undocumented slack api endpoint. Published both as an npm module and a command line tool, Emojme allows me to keep 16,000 emoji synced across multiple slack instances, and has (I believe) been instrumental in forcing Slack to rewrite their /customize page several times over the last few years.",,,
Project;Description;,Slack Yaml Manager,"A hybrid Slackbot and standalone program to allow Slack users create, edit, and run arbitrary jobs based on a shared yaml schema.",,,
Project;Description;,Emojipacks,"A codebase designed for importing bought emoji to Slack, co-opted to enable people to transfer and sync emoji between instances. Uses phantomjs to interact with Slack's frontend, making it slower and more brittle than Emojme.",,,
Project;Description;,html-to-text,"A highly extensible parser, improved upon to better handle complex tables present in Braintree's developer docs. Used as part of Braintree's federated search parser.",,,
Project;Description;,YamlLineNumbers,"A lightweight library to surface source line numbers in parsed ruby hashes, used extensively internally to help identify and resolve issues with kubernetes configs, static allowlist/blocklists, and programmatic documentation.",,,
Project;Description;,Awesome-o,"A stateless Slackbot for parsing Trello boards, tracking open source issues, and crawling internal servers to provide a daily digest of to-do's on Slack.",,,
Project;Description;,Jabiru Medical,"A Northwestern University incubated medical startup in Chicago, involving an Arduino powered proof of concept device designed to help pregnant women understand stressors on crucial muscle groups.",,,
Project;Description;,Phyllo.apk,"An experiment in location based distributed information sharing, essentially HackerNews where articles spread literally as viruses do, from carrier to carrier based on location and proximity. Includes an Android app and Django backend.",,,
